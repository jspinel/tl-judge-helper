## Changelog:
2021-08-08 - First commit

MD files for helping keep track of submitted flags per team. This vault can be easily imported into [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md). Originally created in Joplin, converted to Obsidian due to the extensive metadata Joplin stores. 

When the Cases are released clone the TEAM1\MP1 file into the different MP cases

When the first flag comes in, clone TEAM1 into the team's name & repeat as required.

As you accept flags you can keep track of the flags within each category using numbered or unordered lists with the following syntax: `[Flag](URL)` for example, in the case of a social media account:
`[MP's Twitter](www.twitter.com/username)` which within Obsidian or Joplin will appear as a hyperlink [Twitter](www.twitter.com)
